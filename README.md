## Support and Extending

This Tool is a small sideproject, however any help in extending this Project is welcome.
I cant guarantee the flawless functionality, so this Tool is to be used on own Risk.

## Use Case

This Tool is designed to simplify the usage of a Virtual Machine wrapped by Vagrant on a Windows Computer.
However all this Program does, is also pushing Commands to the Windows Command Line, it is easy to Use and Understand.

## Functionality

Commands are Triggered by the Buttons and while Vagrant is Processing all Output Events are fetched and printed to the Textbox.
The Custom Command Box allows to Trigger any Command in the Command line of the desired Folder.

The Execution Location is Defaulted to the Location where the VagrantGui.exe is located. 
However any Provided Directory is selected if choosen.
